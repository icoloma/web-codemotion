      <h1>The agenda is not yet ready</h1>
      <p>Sorry about that. We will have it published after the C4P is closed, and it's going to be awesome.
      <p>In the meantime, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Z2qNJP-Ha4N9G_4L1sdA2CmI3ZU7Acs-1pNBaF3PRQw/viewform">we have an open poll</a> to learn which technologies you want to see at Codemotion. This is what we are going to use to compose the agenda, so go right now and vote your favorite tech thing!
